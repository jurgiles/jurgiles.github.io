To make my life more difficult, my goal is to become more proficient in Vim. I'm going to use this as my cheatsheet as I attempt to improve while exlusively using Vim for this website. Normally, I would keep these as my personal notes on a desktop app like OSX's `Notes`, but hopefully it helps someone else.
- Navigation
  - `:ex` opens `netrw`, default folder navigator in vim
  - `:vex` opens vertical split
  - `:sex` opens horizontal split - pervs.
