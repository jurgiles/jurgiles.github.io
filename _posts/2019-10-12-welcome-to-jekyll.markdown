As an lead of a team, ever since your organization got the 'Agile' kick, you've had to attend/faciltiate stand-ups that no one likes. 

If this is you, here are some other symptons you may experience:
- Painfully long 20-60 min meetings
- Standups involving 20+ people
- Rarely is a team member blocked or they're always blocked
- You often hear 'I\'m still working on this and going to continue working on this' (sometimes for weeks)
- Rarely are smaller breakout sessions taking place after standup

### What should a standup feel like?
The stand-ups should feel valuable to you at least 2/3 of the time. They won't always be for you, but if they're not mostly for you then maybe you shouldn't be there. In order to paint a better picture, stop by [Jason Yip's](http://jchyip.blogspot.com/) post on  [What might "good" look like? (for stand-ups)](https://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html#WhatMightx201cgoodx201dLookLike "Darn TWers for the win").
